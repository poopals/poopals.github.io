            <p>Your new favourite App, track your poops, make friends and never feel alone in the toilet anymore</p></div>
        <div><h1>Our Mission</h1>
            <p>Picture the office toilets - your poopal is the person you can hear sitting in next toilet partition
                shitting like you. He/she can clearly hear that you are pooing, and you can hear them poo. Poopals very
                rarely meet in person after pooing, the last one usually waits till long after the first one has
                finished.</p>

            <p>Poopals are often unwanted as they ruin the moment of peace and quiet reflection you had going
                on until he/she arrived.</p>
            <p>
                At the time of pooping, we all form an interconnected net of anuses. Our
                mission is to bring us closer as people and to let everyone know that they are not alone. Shitting
                brothers. Poo Pals.
